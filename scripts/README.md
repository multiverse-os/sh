# Multiverse OS: Assorted Shell Scripts
===============================================================================
The shell framework provides Multiverse developers and users access to critical
security logic compiled by Multiverse developers, tested by developers and
users.

This centralizes the responsibility for security logic; such as user input,
type validation, os helper functions and other common utilities useful for
interacting with the operating system.

Access to other functionality, that was implemented to provide functionality
used to prototype fundamental components of Multiverse OS, such as provioning
scripts required to develop and test the design of Portal Gun.

Available modules include, 'vfio', 'vm management', 'pci device control', and
other extra features are compartmentalized into modules that are capable of
being imported all at once, piecemeal, or individually. This allows the code
footprint to be as little as possible.


===============================================================================
## Experimental and Extra Scripts
Functionality that is being tested but does not yet reflect the quality
requirements or does not obviously provide functionality desirable by either
Multiverse OS developers or users. 

This directory contains several random scripts, containing a very specific
functionality, either to test it, or because they work better as a command
in the development stages.
