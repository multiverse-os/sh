# Scramble Shell


## Scramble Terminal
A replacement for Gnome Terminal, both client side and server side to pull out  a lot of the legacy functionality and rebuild the terminal server and client functionality in a more logical, modular, highly scriptable and maximum, real-time control and monitoring over running processes. 


  * Per IP/Device command line, basically you typically have `user@host~$`, well, we will have user@[host:through:WAN192.168.0.42]~$ and hitting something like ALT+TAB (not that but simialar to cycle through available internet connections. Any command ran will use that internet connection exclusively. 

  In adddition, remote hosts will be options to cycle through, AND groups of machines. Organized a variety of ways. Like Multiverse OS VM type, tags, remote/local, etc.
